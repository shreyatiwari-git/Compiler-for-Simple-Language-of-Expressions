# Compiler-for-Simple-Language-of-Expressions
A compiler is a program which takes an input program in a source language S and outputs an equivalent
program in a target language Targ. The source language is typically a language like C or C++, and the
target language is usually machine language, i.e. code which can be executed by the machine. For instance,
you may have used G++ or Clang to compile the code youâ€™ve written.
I have already created an expression evaluator for a simple language of arithmetic expressions, E++,
in one of my repository. In this part, you will improve your implementation of make it more efficient. Further, I
have created a compiler to this language of expressions E++, which does not evaluate the
program, but simply generates code for it which will run on a machine.
For evaluation, some test cases will be made available to you to help you debug your program.
